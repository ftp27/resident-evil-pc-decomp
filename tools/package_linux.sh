# package_linux.sh - build a self-contained Linux x86-32 bundle.
#
# The game is a 32-bit ELF dynamically linked against SDL2 and ffmpeg, and no
# two distributions agree on the ffmpeg sonames (ffmpeg 6 = libavcodec.so.60 on
# the Ubuntu build host, ffmpeg 9 = libavcodec.so.62 on Arch/CachyOS), so the
# libraries travel with the binary and the launcher points LD_LIBRARY_PATH at
# them. That is also the only way onto a Steam Deck: SteamOS has a read-only
# rootfs and a frozen package repo, so the libraries cannot be installed there.
#
# Usage (from the repo root, on the Linux build host):
#   bash tools/package_linux.sh [--no-build] [--with-assets] [--out DIR]
#
# Output: <out>/residentevil-<version>-linux-x86/
#   residentevil          the game (ELF32 i386)
#   residentevil.sh       launcher (cd's here, sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH)
#   lib/                  bundled 32-bit libraries
#   README-LINUX.txt      how to run it and where the game data goes
#
# Game data is NOT bundled by default - it is the retail game's, the same
# policy as the Windows release. --with-assets copies assets/ for a personal
# deployment (about 1.2 GB).

Resident Evil PC decomp - Linux x86 (32-bit), version $VERSION
============================================================

Run:
    ./residentevil.sh

The launcher cd's into this directory and puts lib/ on LD_LIBRARY_PATH, so the
bundled 32-bit libraries are used instead of whatever this distribution happens
to have (or does not have) - including SDL2, ffmpeg, the X11/Wayland clients and
the ALSA/PulseAudio clients.

The GL driver stack (libGL, libEGL, libdrm, libgbm, libvulkan) is deliberately
NOT bundled: it has to match the running kernel and GPU, so the system provides
it. On Arch/CachyOS that means lib32-mesa (SteamOS and any 32-bit-capable
desktop already have it).

Game data is not included. Put your Resident Evil (1996 PC) data tree next to
this file as USA/ (and JPN/ for the Japanese PC version):

    USA/...
    JPN/...        optional

That is the default: [Assets] Path in config.ini is empty, meaning "the folder
this executable is in", and saves go to save/ beside it. config.ini is created
here on first run; its [Assets] Path and [Save] Path settings point the data
and saves somewhere else instead (relative paths resolve from this folder).

Requirements: a 64-bit distribution with 32-bit support (multilib), and glibc
$GLIBC or newer. On a Steam Deck, add residentevil.sh as a non-Steam game
(Desktop Mode -> right-click Steam -> Add a Non-Steam Game) rather than
launching it through the Steam Linux Runtime, whose older glibc the build does
not target.

Diagnostics go to stderr; RE1_DEBUGLOG=1 also appends them to re1_debug.log.
A fatal signal writes a symbolized crash.log in this directory.
